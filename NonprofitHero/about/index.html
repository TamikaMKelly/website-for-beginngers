    <p>I interned at a nonprofit domestic violence agency while in college. 
        They hired me out of college and my first position was a Client Advocate. 
        I was ready to save the world as we all are right out of college. 
        My mind was solely on directly helping the clients, so if I forgot to update the case notes, it was no big deal. 
        I was soon promoted to the Program Director and quickly learned the importance of case notes and all other paperwork. 
        Yes, the dreaded paperwork. However, if it is not documented, IT DID NOT HAPPEN.  As the Client Advocate, 
        I did not realize the link between documentation and our government funding.
    <br>
    <br>

    Flash forward to an over two-decade career in government where most of that time I was a Grants Administrator.  
        I have been on all sides of a grant, the person who developed the solicitation, the person who responded to solicitations, and the person who sat on proposal review panels.  
        To say I have been on all sides of a grant proposal is an understatement. Being on review panels gives you great insight into what Bidders are doing right and wrong. 
        I created Nonprofit Hero to help women Founders of established organizations avoid the pitfalls and go to a steady six-figures level that can come with government funding. </p>
